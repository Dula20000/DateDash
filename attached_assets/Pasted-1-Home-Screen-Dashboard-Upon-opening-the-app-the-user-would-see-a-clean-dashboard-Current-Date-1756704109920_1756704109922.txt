1. Home Screen / Dashboard
Upon opening the app, the user would see a clean dashboard.

Current Date: Prominently displayed.
"Start New Workout" Button: The primary call to action.
"View Progress" Button: To access historical data and trends.
Quick Stats (Optional): Could show a brief summary like "Last Workout: Yesterday" or "This Week's Volume: X lbs."
2. Start New Workout Flow
Clicking "Start New Workout" would lead to the exercise selection screen.

Category Selection:
Users could choose between predefined categories like:
Upper Body
Lower Body
Back
Push
Pull
Legs
Full Body
Or a custom category if the app allows
This could be implemented as a horizontal scrolling list of buttons or a dropdown menu.
Exercise List:
Once a category is selected, a list of common exercises for that category appears.
A search bar would allow users to quickly find specific exercises.
"Add Custom Exercise" option for new or unique movements.
Logging Exercise Data:
After selecting an exercise (e.g., "Bench Press"), the logging interface appears.
Weight, Sets, Reps Dials: Three horizontal "slider" type dials, each with a clear numerical display of the current value. Users would swipe horizontally to adjust the numbers.
Unit Toggle: Directly below the dials, a prominent toggle button or switch for "Lbs / Kg." This would convert the displayed and logged weight.
"Add Set" Button: Allows users to add multiple sets for the same exercise. Each set logged would capture the weight, reps, and the date/time.
"Finish Exercise" / "Add Another Exercise" Buttons: To complete the current exercise logging and either return to the exercise selection or finish the workout.
3. View Progress Section
This section is where users can visualize their historical data and trends.

Workout Log List: A chronological list of all past workouts, showing the date and perhaps a summary (e.g., "Upper Body Workout - 5 Exercises"). Tapping on a workout would show all exercises, sets, and reps for that specific date.
Trend Analysis (The "Magic" Part):
Filter Options: Users can filter trends by:
Timeframe: Last week, last month, last 3 months, last year, all time.
Category: Upper Body, Lower Body, Push, Pull, Leg, Specific Muscle Group (e.g., Chest, Biceps).
Specific Exercise: (e.g., Bench Press, Squat, Deadlift).
Visualization:
Graphs: Line graphs showing weight progression over time for an exercise or category. Bar charts showing total volume for a period.
Key Metrics:
"Over the last month, your upper body weights went up an average of 22% over all muscle groups." (This would involve calculating the average percentage increase in the heaviest set for all upper body exercises logged within that period).
"New Personal Best: Bench Press - 225 lbs (5 reps) on [Date]"
"Total Volume this week: 15,000 lbs"
"Most Frequent Exercise: [Exercise Name]"
"Average Reps per Set: X"
